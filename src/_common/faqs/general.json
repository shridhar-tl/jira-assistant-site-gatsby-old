            "Why Jira Assistant is free and how does it generate revenue?"
        ],
        "answer": "Jira Assistant began as a simple utility in 2016 for quickly adding worklog and pulling reports from Jira. Hence its motive is not to generate revenue. However, due to browser updates and other factors, it requires considerable effort to maintain the stability of the tool. Hence contributions from users in any form are welcome."

        ],
        "answer": "Jira Assistant pulls the data from Jira by calling the API exposed by Jira. Sometimes due to indexing issues, Jira API doesn't return some worklog, issues, comments, etc.,. If you face such issues, then I would suggest to check with your Jira admin and see if indexing in Jira is optimal. Most of the times, re-indexing Jira solves this issue of missing data in JA. This is not really an issue with this tool, but in Jira's API."

        "answer": "Jira Assistant is a free tool and is developed and maintained by a single developer. Due to the huge volume of support incidents and other priorities, it may not be always feasible for the developer to respond on timely basis. While contacting the developer, always provide exact information about the issue you are facing along with required screenshots / console errors if any. Unfortunately, not all issues are resolved and sometimes may not be attended due to other priorities."

If you open a Jira ticket, all the notifications related to that ticket is automatically not pulled next time. That way, only option to not show notification next time is to open individual tickets. There could be some better options in future and until then please bear with me."
