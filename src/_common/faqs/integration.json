This is particularly necessary because JA does not ask for/store your credentials and directly connect to Jira with the authentication established by your browser."

Ensure to use http:// or https:// appropriately. Also see to that you provide Jira base path and not page url. Jira base path would be something like https://jira.yourcompany.com or https://yourcompany.com/jira or https://yourcompany.atlassian.net. Don't provide url's like https://jira.yourcompany.com/browse, which would fail with network error."

        "answer": "Primarily users will have to be logged into Jira from the same browser where JA is used. Some times user get this error even when user is authenticated with Jira. The reason for that is JA need to access to Jira and sometimes for some users, this access is automatically removed. The root cause for that is still unidentified, but is believed to be environmental issue. To solve it, from 401 page in JA, just click on \"Grant permission\" button and the issue would be resolved. Have a look at #214 in GitHub issue tracker for more details."

If you still continue to face this issue, open console tab (F12) and see if you are getting any CORS issue. If you see CORS issue, try upgrading your browser. If issue persist, then contact the developer for any additional support. But this CORS issue, as of date is non reproducible in developer end and so unfortunately no solution is available."

But for specific users, it doesn't work and so far root cause is not identified. As this issue is not reproducible, it becomes difficult for the developer to fix it.
