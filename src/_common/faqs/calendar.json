You have an option to configure the number of how many characters has to be entered to consider it as a valid comment. To configure this, go to Settings > General > Worklog [Tab] and find the section \"Min length for worklog comments\" and edit the minimum characters required. Setting this to '0' would make it a non mandatory field."
