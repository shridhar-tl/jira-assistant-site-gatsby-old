        "answer": "Unfortunately, JA is developed and maintained by a single developer and as of now no other support is available. Hence it becomes difficult for a single developer to allocate time of replying to chats or resolving a bug on time. Queries raised are prioritized and resolved based on the supporting details provided and severity of the query"

        ],
        "answer": "JA Web would receive updates as and when the issue is fixed and has a quicker turn around. But when it comes to extensions/desktop apps, it takes more time due to the waiting time in queue and publish of the store. Due to this waiting time, there will not be frequent publishes unless there are major bug fixes/features."

        "answer": "Some times their could be fixes specific to a browser or their could be very minor feature additions. So in such cases not all browsers gets JA updates immediately. But after a month or two, it would get updated along with new additions. Their could be one more reason where their was major refactoring in code which could have some negative impacts. In such cases also updates are first published to one browser for testing."

        "answer": "Chrome extension is updated on phased basis to avoid any breaking changes impacting all users. So it is pushed to a specific percentage of users and slowly pushed to other users over a time period. Hence you can either wait till it happens automatically or just go to \"chrome://extensions\" page and click update to immediately update your extension."

If you are badly in need of a feature and if you are willing to make a one-time contribution for it, then after raising the ticket, you can contact the developer through mail. We can discuss further on it."

With Vivaldi it is known to work well, but is not officially supported at this point. Additionally this can also be installed as an App within Jira cloud and let all your employee's use it."

        "answer": "Being a single developer, it is very difficult for us to getting into calls with individual users. So, we would suggest you to raise a support ticket with required details in Git Hub. Alternatively, if it is a question, discussions under GitHub can be used to ask your question."
