        "answer": "From any of the reports, the user list popup doesn't save the details persistently. If you permanently want to save the users, then go to Settings > User groups and save the user groups to persist them. So, while generating report, sometimes if you want to generate report for only few set of users/groups, you can safely remove other users from popup and generate report. Once you reload the report, you will still see the old set of users."

        "answer": "From any of the reports, the user list popup doesn't save the details persistently. So, if you don't want to generate the report for a specific user, then you can safely remove the user/group from the reports page. It will not get saved and so next time you reload the report, all the saved users/groups will be populated again. Hence no separate users/groups selection is required in any of the reports."

If you are sure that filters you provided is accurate and still worklog is missing, then it is probably the issue with Indexing in Jira. If there are any recent updates or it has been sometimes long since last indexing in Jira has happened, then most probably re-indexing Jira would solve this issue. Contact your Jira admin about re-indexing."

For example, you can add a label to all the issues for which billing is not necessary and in worklog report, you can add a JQL filter to not pull issues with those labels."
